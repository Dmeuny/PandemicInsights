This project involved analyzing a large dataset of COVID-19 cases using SQL queries. The data was organized into tables and queried using SQL to extract key metrics such as the number of cases, deaths, and various locations. This project also involved joining different tables to perform more complex analyses, such as identifying hotspots or tracking the spread of the virus over time. The insights gained from this analysis are also able to be presented in a report or dashboard (See Link Below).
